USAGE: whensalat [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
	-n     Print next salat
	-c     Clear cached salat times
	-m     Set method
	       (see method section in aladhan.com/prayer-times-api#GetCalendar)
```
## Why?
I don't want to open a web browser just to know a when the next salat will be.  
And it also can be used in a script to show the next salat in a task bar (e.g. along side the time clock, so when you look at the clock you know when is the next salat)
